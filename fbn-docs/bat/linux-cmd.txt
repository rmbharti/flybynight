ormally when starting you get the pid returend like so:

~ $ nohup java -jar server.jar &
[1] 3305
~ $ nohup: ignoring input and appending output to ‘nohup.out’
to see if it is running you can issue

~ $ ps -ef | grep  server
user1  3305  2936  0 13:58 pts/1    00:00:00 java -jar server.jar
if you see a line like the above it is running. You may also hava a look at the nohup.out file, which is written to the directory you started the server in, by using

tail nohup.out
to kill the process issue kill . Where pid is the process id, you either remembered, or will find out by looking at the second row of the "ps -ef | grep server" command, in our case 3305

kill 3305
